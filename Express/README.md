## Introduction

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating APIs, handling routes, and `managing HTTP requests and responses`. With its lightweight and unopinionated structure, Express allows developers to quickly build scalable and efficient server-side applications. It's widely used in the Node.js ecosystem for building both simple and complex web applications.

## Express Functionality

Express.js provides a wide range of features and functionality for building web applications. Some of the key features include:

- **Routing**: Express provides a simple and effective way to define routes for handling HTTP requests. Developers can define routes for different `HTTP` methods `(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)` and specify the corresponding handler functions to process the requests.

- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are a core part of the Express framework. They provide a way to execute code at different stages of the request-response cycle. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and more.

- **Template Engines**: Express supports various template engines such as `Pug`, `EJS`, `Handlebars`, and more. These template engines allow developers to generate dynamic HTML content by using templates and data.

- **Error Handling**: Express provides a robust error handling mechanism that allows developers to define error-handling middleware functions. These functions can be used to handle errors that occur during the execution of the application.
