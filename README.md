| Express.js         | <img src="./assets/express.png" alt="Node.js" style="max-width:100px;">               | Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating APIs, handling routes, and `managing HTTP requests and responses`. With its lightweight and unopinionated structure, Express allows developers to quickly build scalable and efficient server-side applications. It's widely used in the Node.js ecosystem for building both simple and complex web applications.                                                                                                    | [here](./Node)       |
| Cloudflare Workers | <img src="./assets/cloudflare.svg" alt="Cloudflare Workers" style="max-width:100px;"> | Cloudflare Workers is a serverless execution environment that allows developers to deploy and run JavaScript applications at the edge of the Cloudflare network. With Workers, developers can execute code closer to end-users, improving performance and reducing latency. Workers provide powerful features such as routing, caching, and manipulation of HTTP requests and responses, enabling developers to build fast and resilient applications. They are highly scalable and integrate seamlessly with other Cloudflare services, making them a popular choice for building modern serverless applications. | [here](./Cloudflare) |
